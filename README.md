# Tem-adapter: Adapting Image-Text Pretraining for Video Question Answer

This repository contains PyTorch implementation for ICCV2023 paper __Tem-adapter: Adapting Image-Text Pretraining for Video Question Answer__ [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08414v1.pdf)


# Large Language Models are Temporal and Causal Reasoners for Video Question Answering

This repository also contains the official implementation of Flipped-VQA (EMNLP 2023) (arxiv) (demo).

Each of those repositories can be used with their respective README files (TemAdapterREADME.md in main and the README in the Flipped-VQA directory)

This is the codebase Jim Su and Benjamin Cortese operated on this semester in projects in data science
